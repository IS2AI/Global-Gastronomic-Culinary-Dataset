# Global Food Scenes Dataset

In this work, we propose the Global Food Scenes Dataset, a followup of our previous work Central Asian Food Scenes Dataset (CAFSD) combined with Nutrition5k dataset[1] annotated with bounding boxes. 
The Nutrition5k contains 3.5k datasets taken from overhead angle
We annotated the Nutrition5k dataset with bounding boxes resulting in 12,839 images across 113 classes. 

The final combined dataset which we call Global Food Scenes Dataset contains 34,145 images across 241 food classes. Some visual examples of a few classes are shown for the annotated Nutrition5k and CAFSD datasets in the figure below.

_The images in the right-hand side are sampled from the annotated Nutrition5k dataset whereas left images are from the CAFSD.

The table below shows the number of images per split across different datasets.
| Dataset | Train  | Valid | Test |
|---------|--------|-------|------|
| CAFSD   | 17,046 | 2,084 | 2,176|
| Google  | 10,257 | 1,272 | 1,310|
| GFSD    | 27,303 | 3,356 | 3,486|


The statistics of classes grouped into 18 coarse categories are shown in Figure below.
